Cross-platform mobile application using Googles Flutter Technology.

## Overview

The application will present the user with the option to post or view lost and found animals in a selected area. There will be a range of features, such as push notifications if an animal is reported lost in a userâ€™s area, searching for posts based on location and communicating with other users via comments.
